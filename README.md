**Keyin College - Advanced Programming (Java) - QAP 3**

Thank you for checking out my third QAP in my Java course at Keyin College.

Please see the PDF for the complete instructions:
[QAP3.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17848542/QAP3.pdf)

The 5 questions below were part of the required work:

*1. How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)*
  I spent approximately 3 or 4 hours on this assignment. I worked at a pretty relaxed pace. I would say that questions 2 and 3 took the longest.
  
*2. What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)*
  Most of the information I needed was in the class notes for the course. I did use ChatGPT for question 3 because I was intimidated by the math, but it wwasn't nearly as complex as it looked to me at a glance. I also used this resource to clarify the difference between an abstract class and an interface: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-abstract-class-and-interface-in-java/

*3. Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)*
   I did not consult with my peers.

*4. Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?*
  I asked my instructor about interfaces but I was able to figure it out.

*5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.*
  I think this was an appropriate level of difficulty. I could definitley solve similar problems in a shorter time.
